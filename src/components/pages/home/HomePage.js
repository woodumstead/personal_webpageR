            My name is Woody,
<br></br>
<br></br>
I have over a decade of government work experience and looking to break into the private sector. Currently working as a freelance web dev 
helping small businesses gain a web footprint. 
I have a huge interest in back-end development, especially serverless frameworks.

            Some of my hobbies
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
I grew up a football(soccer) fan, playing in punk rock bands. My fitness
is usually found outside playing football(soccer), swimming, surfing, 
golfing, or running. When the rains come, it's time to play
music and chess and make delicious food.
