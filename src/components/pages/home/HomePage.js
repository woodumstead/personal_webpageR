            My name is Woody,
<br></br>
<br></br>
I have over a decade of government work experience and
currently looking to break into the private sector. This past year 
I finished up a six month coding bootcamp and have been able
to learn about the giant world of programming. I have a huge 
interest in back end development especially serverless frameworks.

            Some of my hobbies
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
I grew up a football(soccer) fan, playing in punk rock bands. My fitness
is usually found outside playing football(soccer), swimming, surfing, 
golfing, or running. When the rains come is when it's time to play
music and chess and make delicious food.
